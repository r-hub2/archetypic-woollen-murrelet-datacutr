# Introduction 

This vignette gives you an overview of the anticipated contribution model.
The goal is to enable users of `{datacutr}` to contribute and test the contribution model for `{datacutr}`. Adjustments might be made over time.

# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/datacutr/issues) to put it in our backlog. 
 
 * All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/datacutr/issues) will be reviewed and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user request” so we can easily identify new requests).

# Contribution Model

 * First, the user creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that they’d like to contribute enhancements to `{datacutr}`.
 
 * A `{datacutr}` core development team member will be in touch to discuss next steps.
